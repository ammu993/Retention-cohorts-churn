## Overview
Weekly subscription cohort analysis to comprehend retention over six weeks, utilizing BigQuery and Google Spreadsheets

## Project Structure
Explain the organization of your project, including key folders and files.

## Tools and Technologies
Big Query & Google Spreadsheets

## Data Source
A single table containing information about your usersâ€™ subscriptions curated by the educational institute. This table contains user id, start, end dates of subscriptions and some additional customer-related information such as Country and category (desktop, mobile, tablet).

## Code 
SQL code snippets to get the Retention cohorts analysis chart
```sql
 SELECT
    user_pseudo_id AS users,
    subscription_start AS sub_start,
    subscription_end AS sub_end,
    DATE_TRUNC(subscription_start,WEEK) AS cohort_week,
    DATE_TRUNC(subscription_end, WEEK) AS cancel_week,
  -- category,country,
  FROM
    `data_analytics.subscriptions`
  ORDER BY
    subscription_start
```
Retention from weeks 0-6 in terms of count of subscriptions
```sql
SELECT
  cohort_week,
-- category,country,
  COUNT(sub_start) AS count_subscriptions,
  SUM(CASE
      WHEN sub_end IS NULL OR cancel_week>= DATE_ADD(cohort_week,INTERVAL 1 WEEK) THEN 1
  END
    ) AS week_0,
/*indicates activity in the week the first time subscription was made and if users unsubscribed in the same week as subscription then the rentention in week 0 is less than 100%, can be replaced with logic cohort_week!= cancel_week*/
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN sub_end IS NULL OR cancel_week>= DATE_ADD(cohort_week,INTERVAL 2 WEEK) THEN 1
END
  ) AS week_1,
/*values under this weekly retention columns show subscriptions that are still active in that week(week1, 2...etc), so subscriptions that stayed 1, 2, 3,.. weeks after they initially subscribed*/
  SUM(CASE
      WHEN sub_end IS NULL OR cancel_week>= DATE_ADD(cohort_week,INTERVAL 3 WEEK) THEN 1
  END
    ) AS week_2,
----so on
FROM
  cohorts --cohorts is the name of subquery
GROUP BY
 cohort_week;
```
